Matlab Code for NRSFM: Two methods are included: 1. Bregler's initial method 2. Yuchao Dai's prior free method

1. Please refer to Bregler.m to Bregler's method for NRSFM.

2. For Dai's method, go to "Dai/dai.m" for a successful implementation. This implementation is based on CVX optimization library.
